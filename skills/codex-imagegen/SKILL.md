# Codex Image Generation Skill

Generate and edit images via `codex exec` with the built-in `image_gen` tool.
**No `OPENAI_API_KEY` required.**

## Prerequisites

### Codex CLI

```bash
# Mac / Linux (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh

# Homebrew
brew install --cask codex

# npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Verify: `codex --version`

### Authentication (check this FIRST when generation 404s)

`codex` runs on the ChatGPT account login stored in `~/.codex/auth.json`.
The `id_token` expires roughly 10 hours after it is issued, and **an
expired token does not surface as an auth error** — it comes back as a
model 404:

```
ERROR: unexpected status 404 Not Found: The model `gpt-5.x` does not exist
or you do not have access to it.
```

Every *other* model then fails with `... is not supported when using Codex
with a ChatGPT account`, which makes it look like a plan/entitlement
problem. It is not. The token is simply stale.

Check the expiry before assuming anything else:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, base64, datetime, os
d = json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.codex/auth.json')))
p = d['tokens']['id_token'].split('.')[1]; p += '=' * (-len(p) % 4)
c = json.loads(base64.urlsafe_b64decode(p))
print('exp:', datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(c['exp']).isoformat())
print('now:', datetime.datetime.now().isoformat())
PY
```

If `exp` is in the past, the fix is a re-login. It requires browser auth,
so Claude Code cannot run it — ask the user to run it themselves in the
prompt:

```
! codex login
```

Switching models (`-m gpt-5.4`, `-m gpt-5-codex`, …) does not work around
a stale token: older models are rejected outright for ChatGPT-account
logins. Upgrading the CLI (`codex update`) does not help either.
Re-login is the only fix.

---

## Invocation contract (MUST follow)

The exact shape of the `codex exec` call matters. Use this for every mode:

```bash
cd <OUTPUT_DIR>
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check "<INSTRUCTION>" < /dev/null
```

Four non-obvious requirements, each from a real failure:

- **`--sandbox workspace-write`, never `-s danger-full-access`.** Claude
  Code's auto-mode permission classifier blocks `danger-full-access`, so
  the call never runs at all. Do not retry it or try to route around the
  denial. `workspace-write` is sufficient — it grants write access to the
  working directory plus `/tmp` and `$TMPDIR`.
- **`cd` into the output directory and pass a RELATIVE filename** in the
  instruction (e.g. `hero.png`, not an absolute path). Under
  `workspace-write` only the cwd tree is writable, so the output must live
  inside it. Add "in the current working directory" to the instruction so
  Codex resolves the path the same way.
- **`--skip-git-repo-check`.** Without it, codex refuses to start:
  `Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not
  specified.` Scratchpad directories are not git repos.
- **`< /dev/null`.** Without it, codex blocks on
  `Reading additional input from stdin...` and never returns.

---

## Reliability rules (MUST follow)

These rules come from real production failures. Skipping them produces
silently wrong images.

1. **Delete a stale output file BEFORE generating** (except in-place
   refinement, Mode 3). If the output path already exists, Codex may skip
   generation entirely and report "already saved" while leaving the old
   image in place.

   ```bash
   rm -f <OUTPUT_PATH>
   ```

   Then phrase the instruction as:
   `"The file <OUTPUT_PATH> does not exist yet. You MUST generate a
   brand-new image using the built-in image_gen tool and save it to that
   exact path. Do not reuse or copy any previously generated image."`

2. **Verify the output is fresh after every run.** Compare the file's
   mtime against when the command started (`stat -f %m <OUTPUT_PATH>` on
   macOS). If the mtime is old, the run skipped generation: delete the file
   and rerun with the MUST-generate phrasing above.

3. **Isolate concurrent runs with per-job `CODEX_HOME`.** Parallel
   `codex exec` jobs sharing the default `~/.codex` also share
   `~/.codex/generated_images/`. A job whose generation fails may
   "recover" by copying the newest file there, which can be ANOTHER job's
   image, silently writing the wrong picture to the requested path.
   Therefore: **when generating 2+ images, run them in parallel, each with
   its own isolated `CODEX_HOME`** (see "Parallel Generation" below). This
   removes the shared directory and makes parallelism safe. Never run
   parallel jobs against the shared default home; if a past run did,
   visually verify every output and rerun any duplicate solo.

4. **Visually inspect every generated image before using it** (open/Read
   the PNG). Check for: garbled or misspelled text (especially Japanese),
   clipped labels, overlapping elements, broken or wobbly arrows and lines,
   pasted-on-looking text boxes. Regenerate until it passes; do not ship an
   image you have not looked at.

---

## Modes

This skill supports three modes. Claude Code constructs a `codex exec`
command directly — no wrapper script is needed.

### Mode 1: Prompt → Image

Generate an image from a text prompt.

```bash
cd <OUTPUT_DIR>
rm -f <OUTPUT_FILE>
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check \
  "The file <OUTPUT_FILE> in the current working directory does not exist yet. You MUST generate a brand-new image using the built-in image_gen tool and save it to that exact path. Do not reuse or copy any previously generated image. Image prompt: <PROMPT>" < /dev/null
```

#### Prompt construction

Build the prompt by combining these elements in order:

1. **Style** (optional): `Style: watercolor painting.`
2. **Subject**: the user's description
3. **Aspect ratio** (optional): `Use a wide landscape composition (16:9 aspect ratio).`
4. **Negative** (optional): `Avoid: blurry, text, watermark.`

Example:

```
Style: watercolor painting. A mountain landscape at sunset with dramatic clouds.
Use a wide landscape composition (16:9 aspect ratio). Avoid: text, watermark.
```

### Mode 2: Document → Diagram

Pass a large text, Markdown, or PDF file to Codex and have it generate an
information-rich infographic or diagram.

```bash
cd <OUTPUT_DIR>
rm -f <OUTPUT_FILE>
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check \
  "Read the file <INPUT_PATH>. Analyze its content thoroughly and create an information-rich infographic/diagram that visually summarizes the key points, structure, and relationships. The file <OUTPUT_FILE> in the current working directory does not exist yet. You MUST generate the image using the built-in image_gen tool and save it to that exact path. Additional instructions: <USER_INSTRUCTIONS>" < /dev/null
```

- Claude Code reads the document first with the Read tool to understand its
  content, then crafts a detailed instruction for Codex.
- For very large documents, Claude Code should summarize the key points and
  include them directly in the Codex instruction for better results.
- The user's instructions guide the diagram type (infographic, flowchart,
  mind map, concept map, timeline, etc.).
- Follow the "Diagram & infographic quality" section below.

### Mode 3: Image Refinement

Pass an existing image to Codex for modification.

```bash
cd <OUTPUT_DIR>
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check \
  "Look at the image at <INPUT_IMAGE_FILE> in the current working directory. Make the following modifications using the built-in image_gen tool: <MODIFICATION_INSTRUCTIONS>. Overwrite the existing file at <OUTPUT_FILE> with the modified image." < /dev/null
```

- Use for color adjustments, style changes, element additions/removals,
  composition tweaks, etc.
- Reference the original image path so Codex can analyze it.
- **Do NOT pre-delete the file when refining in place** (input == output);
  instead say "Overwrite the existing file". If input and output differ,
  apply Reliability rule 1 to the output path.

---

## Diagram & infographic quality

Diffusion-based generation breaks most often on **arrows and lines**. Design
the composition so there is nothing fragile to break.

### Composition rules

- **Straight, short arrows only.** Never request curved arrows, loop-back
  arrows, or long connector lines weaving between elements. Express cycles
  or bidirectional sync with a small pill label (e.g. 「双方向に同期 ⇄」)
  instead of a curved arrow.
- **No overlapping elements.** Give every label generous spacing; ask for
  "wide margins on every side" so nothing touches the canvas edge.
- **Prefer structures that are hard to break**: side-by-side panels, 2x2
  card grids, stacked horizontal bars, single-row card flows. Avoid dense
  networks, swimlanes, and diagrams that need many crossing connectors.
- Keep the element count low; split into two images rather than cramming.

### Style lines that work

- Flat diagram:
  `Crisp flat vector infographic, white background, styled like a clean
  professional presentation slide. Perfectly straight lines, uniform stroke
  width, sharp clean edges, generous spacing.`
- Graphic recording (grareco):
  `Warm hand-drawn graphic recording style, black ink pen and colored
  pencil accents on warm cream paper, rounded hand lettering.`
  Add `Avoid: digital flat vector look` so the style stays consistent
  across a series.

### Standard Avoid list for diagrams

```
Avoid: watermark, misspelled text, wobbly lines, blur, curved arrows,
overlapping elements, clipped text, stray marks, decorative dots,
sketchy style, 3D effects, photorealism.
```

### Text accuracy (especially Japanese)

- Quote every string that must appear verbatim (e.g. 「承認ゲート」) and add:
  `All Japanese text must be spelled exactly as given and legible.`
- After generation, zoom in and verify every label: tofu/garbled glyphs,
  swapped characters, and clipped endings are the most common failures.

## Generated Image Recovery

Codex may save images to `<CODEX_HOME>/generated_images/` instead of the
requested output path (`~/.codex/generated_images/` for a default-home
run; `$JOB/generated_images/` for an isolated parallel job). After
running `codex exec`:

1. Check if the output file exists at the requested path **and has a fresh
   mtime** (Reliability rule 2).
2. If not, look for the most recently created file in
   `~/.codex/generated_images/` and copy it to the requested output path.

```bash
# Find the latest generated image
ls -t ~/.codex/generated_images/*.png 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

> **Warning:** never blind-copy from `generated_images/` while multiple
> generations are running in parallel — the newest file may belong to a
> different job (Reliability rule 3). Visually confirm the content matches
> the requested prompt before accepting it.

---

## Multiple Images / Parallel Generation

**Default to parallel execution when generating 2+ images.** Serial
execution is only for retries of a single failed image. Parallelism is
safe as long as every job gets its own isolated `CODEX_HOME`
(cross-contamination — Reliability rule 3 — only happens through the
shared `~/.codex/generated_images/` directory).

### Recipe

For each image `i`, prepare an isolated home and launch the job in the
background (use the Bash tool's `run_in_background`, one call per image):

```bash
JOB=<SCRATCHPAD>/codex-job-<i>
mkdir -p "$JOB"
cp ~/.codex/auth.json ~/.codex/config.toml "$JOB/"
cd <OUTPUT_DIR>
rm -f <OUTPUT_FILE_i>
CODEX_HOME="$JOB" codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check \
  "The file <OUTPUT_FILE_i> in the current working directory does not exist yet. You MUST generate a brand-new image using the built-in image_gen tool and save it to that exact path. Do not reuse or copy any previously generated image. Image prompt: <PROMPT_i>" < /dev/null
```

- `auth.json` carries the login; `config.toml` carries user settings.
  Copying both into the job home is enough — no re-login needed. Copy
  `auth.json` fresh at launch time: a copy taken from an already-expired
  token fails every job with the model 404 described under
  "Authentication".
- Launch ALL jobs first, then wait for completions; do not run them one
  by one.
- After each job finishes, apply Reliability rules 2 and 4 to its output
  (fresh mtime + visual inspection). Recovery lookups for that job go to
  `$JOB/generated_images/`, NOT `~/.codex/generated_images/`.
- If a job fails auth (stale token copy), re-copy a fresh
  `~/.codex/auth.json` into its home and rerun that job alone.
- Delete the job homes (`rm -rf <SCRATCHPAD>/codex-job-*`) after all
  outputs are verified.

## Aspect Ratios

| Ratio | Use case |
|---|---|
| 1:1 | Social media icons, thumbnails, profile pictures |
| 16:9 | Banners, hero images, desktop wallpapers |
| 9:16 | Mobile wallpapers, stories, vertical videos |
| 4:3 | Blog images, presentations |
| 3:4 | Portrait photos |
| 3:2 | Classic photography landscape |
| 2:3 | Classic photography portrait |

> The built-in `image_gen` tool does not accept explicit pixel dimensions.
> Aspect ratio and composition are controlled through prompt instructions.

---

## Style Examples

| Style | Description |
|---|---|
| `photorealistic` | Realistic photography look |
| `watercolor` | Watercolor painting style |
| `oil painting` | Classical oil painting style |
| `anime` | Japanese anime style |
| `3D render` | 3D computer graphics |
| `pencil sketch` | Hand-drawn pencil sketch |
| `flat design` | Modern flat design illustration |
| `pixel art` | Retro pixel art style |
| `concept art` | Professional concept art |
| `minimalist` | Clean, minimal design |

See `references/prompts.md` for detailed prompting guidance.

## Limitations

- **No explicit resolution control**: Use aspect ratio and composition
  prompts to influence output proportions.
- **Single image per call**: Each `codex exec` invocation generates one
  image.
- **Codex CLI required**: The `codex` command must be installed and
  authenticated with a non-expired token.
- **Output must live under the working directory**: `workspace-write`
  only permits writes to the cwd tree, `/tmp` and `$TMPDIR`, so every
  invocation `cd`s to the output directory first.
- **Document diagram quality**: Results depend on how well the instruction
  conveys the document's structure. For complex documents, Claude Code
  should pre-summarize key points in the instruction.
- **Fragile geometry**: curved arrows, long connectors, and dense overlaps
  frequently render broken. Design them out (see "Diagram & infographic
  quality").

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|---|---|
| `codex CLI not found` | Install Codex CLI: `curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh \| sh` |
| `404 Not Found: The model ... does not exist or you do not have access to it` | The stored `id_token` expired. Ask the user to run `! codex login`. Do not switch models or update the CLI — neither fixes it (see "Authentication") |
| `The '<model>' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account` | That model is not available to ChatGPT-account logins. Do not pass `-m`; let the configured default model apply |
| `Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified` | Add `--skip-git-repo-check` to the `codex exec` call |
| Command hangs on `Reading additional input from stdin...` | Append `< /dev/null` to the `codex exec` call |
| `-s danger-full-access` call is blocked / denied | Claude Code's permission classifier blocks it. Use `--sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check` with a relative output path under the cwd instead |
| Codex says it cannot write the output path | The path is outside the sandbox. `cd` to the output directory and pass a relative filename |
| `Codex timed out` | The default timeout is ~5 minutes. Retry or simplify the prompt |
| `No images were generated` | Rephrase the prompt; it may have been blocked by safety filters |
| `Image not at expected path` | Check `~/.codex/generated_images/` manually (see recovery warning) |
| Output file unchanged (old mtime) | Codex skipped generation because the file already existed. Delete the file and rerun with the "does not exist yet / MUST generate" phrasing |
| Output duplicates another parallel job's image | Cross-contamination via a shared `generated_images/` — the jobs were run without isolated `CODEX_HOME`. Delete the file and rerun that image alone (or rerun all jobs with per-job `CODEX_HOME`) |
| Parallel job fails with auth error | The copied `auth.json` went stale. Re-copy a fresh `~/.codex/auth.json` into that job's home and rerun it alone |
| Broken arrows / wobbly lines in diagrams | Simplify the composition per "Diagram & infographic quality": straight short arrows only, no curves, generous spacing, then regenerate |
